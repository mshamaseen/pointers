# Installation

First, you will need to have JQuery imported, as this package depends on it.

## NPM

`npm i jquery-pointers`

### Using import

Import `Pointers.js` from `src` folder.

### Add Script

You can get started quickly by including `index.js` or `index.min.js` in the head tag of your HTML code.
